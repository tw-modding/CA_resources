# Official Script Documentation

Herein lies the treasure coves of knowledge. The two documents here are a great foundation for checking basic commands and methods for the game. 

The one document - game_interface_methods.txt - provides a list of methods that one can call on `cm`, ie. `cm:function_name(arg, arg)`.

The other - events_and_interfaces.html - lists Lua events that can be listened for with `add_listener()`, as well as various interfaces from each event context, and the methods within each interface.

### DISCLAIMER
DO NOTE that these documents are not, and will not be, fully complete or fully accurate. Fact check, use at your own discretion, blah blah.
